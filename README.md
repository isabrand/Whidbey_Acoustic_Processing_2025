# Whidbey Acoustic Processing Oct 2024 - July 2025

Puget Sound is a rich ecosystem home to several groups of resident killer whales. These orcas feed on salmon and are a big part of eco-tourism, rendering them important members of the community. Organizations like OrcaSound have dedicated resources to observing and monitoring these populations over time, building a vast dataset of visual identification and acoustic data. Our lab at UW is working on pushing existing limitations of acoustic processing via distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) in order to collect higher frequency orca calls. 

This repo serves as a method of accessing and processing the acoustic data from OrcaSound's many hydrophone locations, as well as the beginnings of data processing from fiber optic cables lit up in the Puget Sound area.
